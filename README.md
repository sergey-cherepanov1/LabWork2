## Description
This project is a simplified terminal-based turn-based strategy game inspired by Heroes of Might and Magic 3, focusing on tactical combat. Players manage troops on a 6x6 grid-based battlefield, engaging in strategic battles against an AI opponent or locally against another player. The game features a turn system where players can move troops, attack enemies, cast hero spells, defend, or skip turns to gain an advantage, all through text-based commands.
